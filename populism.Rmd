# Consider someone whose att_end at the end of the experiment is 1 or more units
# greater than their att_start. They become more conservative on immigration
# issues. Consider such people to have made a meaningful move toward immigration
# populism. Let's use `move_to_pop` as a new variable, defined as TRUE for such
# people. We are interested to see if two variables might be associated with
# move_to_pop: treatment and age.

x <- trains %>% 
  mutate(move_to_pop = ifelse(att_end >= att_start + 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  select(move_to_pop, treatment, age)
